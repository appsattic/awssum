Overview
--------

Project AwsSum is a set of libraries that can help you talk to the Amazon Web
Services. They look simple yet provide the majority of the functionality of the
services themselves (more being added all the time).

Quick Start
-----------

ToDo.

===============================================================================

Future Work
-----------

Currently, Project AwsSum is still young and therefore not yet feature
complete. I wish to expand this so every command for all the relevant services
have been added.
