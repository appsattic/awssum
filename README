Overview
--------

AwsSum is a set of libraries that can talk to a number of online Web
Services. It is designed to be basic so that the hard part of talking to the
services is done, yet they provide a simple interface for you to build
applications on top of them.

The main design choice for AwsSum is not modelling hundreds of classes
dependent on what the data is going in or out, but instead to provide a basic
interface which takes a hash for the request and returns a hash of the
response.

Services
--------

The ones I'm currently working on are:

* Flickr
* Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, SNS, SQS, CloudFront, etc)
* RackspaceCloud
* PayPal
* GoogleFS

Data Normalisation
------------------

Some web services do weird and wonderful things when returning data whereas
others are really nice. Some examples are:

* RackspaceCloud can talk in native JSON (which is very nice)
* Flickr can return JSON but it's basically already been converted from XML
* AWS returns only XML which we have to convert ourselves
* PayPal's Name-Value-Pair interface returns interesting L_BLAH# lists

Sometimes it's nice to tidy these up a little bit before returning the data to
the calling routine so that it looks like each service returns a clean set of
data.

Error responses are also dealt with specifically. Generally they are left as-is
but bits are copied to another part of the hash ($h->{_error}) along with any
associated code or message. Again this is useful for programs so that they
don't have to figure out where the errors are for each service and can assume
they are always in the same place.
