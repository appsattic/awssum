If you would like to use any of these images, go ahead (and attribute either of the following links). It would be great if you could tell me about it. I can be reached at either of these places:

Other licenses may be available upon request. Please ask, I'll probably say yes!

The photos have the MD5 sums as shown. If they do not have those MD5 sums, then the images are either not mine or have been altered, which they shouldn't have been. Please get a fresh copy from the repository.
